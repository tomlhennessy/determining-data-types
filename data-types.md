# Determine Data Types

* The "typeof" operator is used to test if a value is a number, string, or function.
* The "Array.isArray" method is used to check if a value is an array.
* null means "no value" or "unknown value". Check that a value is null by using the strict equality operator "x === null".
undefined is used for variables that have not been assigned a value. Test if a value is undefined by using the strict equality operator "x === undefined".
